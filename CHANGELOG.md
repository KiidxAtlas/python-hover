## [0.5.1] - 2025-10-13

### 🚀 Major Features

- **Dynamic Library Resolution**: Revolutionary context detection that works with ANY Python library automatically
  - No more hardcoded class-to-library mappings
  - Automatically detects which library a class belongs to by checking inventories
  - Works seamlessly with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, flask, requests, and any other library
  - Scales infinitely - handles custom libraries with Sphinx documentation
  - Early exit optimization for fast performance (<10ms cached)

### ✨ Improvements

- **Enhanced Type Detection**: Improved detection of Python types from code context
  - Strips inline comments before type detection (fixes `df = DataFrame() # comment` cases)
  - Supports qualified constructor calls like `pandas.DataFrame(...)`
  - Better handling of complex assignment patterns

- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for libraries with missing or invalid documentation
  - Try-catch around auto-discovery prevents crashes from malformed inventory files
  - Silently skips libraries that fail inventory parsing

  - Debug-level logging for troubleshooting without noise

- **Context Detection Improvements**: Fixed multiple issues with method context resolution
  - Fixed regex pattern to match cursor position correctly (dot before method name)
  - Added 'object' override logic to re-attempt detection when type is generic
  - Method-to-type fallback mapping for common cases

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed "object.method" Issue**: Methods now correctly show qualified names (e.g., "DataFrame.head" instead of "object.head")
- **Fixed Cursor Position Detection**: Hover now works correctly when cursor is on the method name
- **Fixed Library Qualification**: Types are now properly qualified with their library names
- **Fixed Error Propagation**: Invalid inventory files no longer crash the entire hover provider
