# Release Notes: Python Hover v0.4.2

**Release Date:** October 10, 2025

## 🎯 What's New in 0.4.2

This release focuses on **critical bug fixes** and **quality improvements** to make Python Hover more reliable and easier to debug.

---

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### ✅ Method Hover Lookups Now Work Correctly

**The Problem:**
- Method hovers like `str.upper()`, `list.append()`, `dict.keys()` were showing "no documentation found"
- Symbol resolver returned qualified names (e.g., "text.upper") but the documentation MAP expected simple keys (e.g., "upper")

**The Fix:**
- Added proper symbol extraction logic after method name extraction
- Now correctly updates `primarySymbol.symbol` to use the extracted method name
- All built-in method hovers now work for str, list, dict, set, and other types

**Impact:** This was blocking documentation for dozens of commonly-used Python methods. Now fixed! 🎉

---

### ✅ No More Annoying Cancellation Errors

**The Problem:**
- Users saw "Canceled" error messages in the status bar when dismissing VS Code prompts
- ErrorNotifier was showing all errors, including intentional user cancellations

**The Fix:**
- Added filtering for VS Code cancellation errors (error code -32800)
- ErrorNotifier now ignores these expected cancellation events

**Impact:** Much cleaner UX with no unnecessary error messages.

---

### ✅ Generic Documentation Pages Fixed

**The Problem:**
- Built-in functions like `range()`, `len()`, `print()` were showing a generic "Built-in Functions" page
- Not helpful for users who want specific function documentation

**The Fix:**
- Added detection for generic documentation pages in `createRichHover()`
- Falls back to basic hover when generic page detected
- Improved documentation quality for built-in functions

**Impact:** Better, more specific documentation for built-in Python functions.

## ✨ New Features & Improvements

### 📺 Enhanced Logging with Output Channel

**What's New:**
- Logger now creates a proper VS Code Output Channel named "Python Hover"
- All logs visible in **Output panel** (View → Output → Python Hover)
- Dual logging to both Output Channel and console for better debugging
- Makes troubleshooting much easier for users and developers

**How to Use:**
1. Open Output panel: `View → Output` or `Cmd+Shift+U` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+U` (Windows)
2. Select "Python Hover" from dropdown
3. See all extension activity in real-time

---

### 🎨 Improved Hover Content Formatting

- Better code formatting with proper syntax highlighting
- Enhanced example presentation with clear section separation
- Improved visual styling for better readability
- Consistent formatting across all hover types

---

### 🔍 Better Debug Capabilities

- Tracks hover triggers, symbol resolution, context detection
- Shows Python version detection and environment setup
- Logs documentation fetching and MAP lookups
- Method name extraction fully traced

---

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Symbol Resolution
- Improved method name extraction logic
- Handles qualified names like "obj.method" correctly
- Preserves context information (str, list, dict, etc.)
- Ensures MAP lookups use correct simple keys
- Better handling of third-party library methods

### Error Handling
- More robust error handling throughout extension
- Filters out user-cancelled operations
- Better error messages for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks when documentation not found
